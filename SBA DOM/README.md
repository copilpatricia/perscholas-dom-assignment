# Description of the application

I created an application using the Document Object Model methods such as selectElementById and querrySelectorAll.

I nagivated between elements using their familial relationship.

I created elements using createElemenet method.

I used an interation method to set the attribute for every link in the navbar.

I used the appendChild method to create the content inside the main tag, then to modify the textContent and style of the h1 tag.

In order to change the attribute of the image source in response to user interaction I added another image.

I used the click and submit event listeners associated with their event handler functions.

# Sign Up Form

I created a sign up form for the user and for the email, password and terms inputs I used the HTML validation.

For the user and password check inputs I used the DOM event-based validation.

# Browser Object Model

I used the window.open and window.focus methods to display my linkedIn Page when the user click the Contact section.
